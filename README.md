The VR-chat setup consists of a Flask Python server and some test Aframe networked clients. 

To start the server:

> python server.py

The clients can be started in a dev server using parcel (`npm install -g parcel-bundler`):

> parcel src/*.html

Then navigate to localhost:1234/index.html and kick off some avatars.
